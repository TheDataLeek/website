\maketitle

The goal of this lab is to understand Markovian Queues.

Let $X = \pren{X_t}_{t \ge 0}$ denote the number of customers in an M/M/1-queue
with arrival rate $\lambda > 0$ and service rate $\mu > 0$. In addition, let $T
> 0$ be a fixed time.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{easylist}[enumerate]
    @ What condition is necessary and sufficient for the queue to have a
    stationary distribution? What is it?
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    In  order for the queue to have a stationary distribution, $\lambda$ must be
    less than $\mu$. To put this in simpler terms, the rate of incoming events
    must be lower than the rate of outgoing, or else the system will infinitely
    increase. We can define a new parameter $\rho = \lambda / \mu$. This value
    must be less than $1$ in order for there to be a stationary distribution.

    Following the example in the book on page 160, we can find the stationary
    distribution to be the following.

    \begin{align*}
        \pi(n) =
        \pren{1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}}
        \pren{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}}^n
        \qquad \text{for } n \ge 0
    \end{align*}

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ When $X$ is stationary what's the distribution of $X_T$?
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    If we assume that $X$ is stationary, this means that $\rho < 1$, which means
    that $\lambda < \mu$. If this is true, then the system will ``fall'' to
    zero, and the system after duration $T$ will be geometrically distributed
    with parameter $1 - \rho = 1 - \lambda / \mu$.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ When $X$ is stationary, what fraction of the time is the server busy?
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Using our fancy new parameter again, we note that the fraction of the time
    that the server is busy is simply the fraction of the rates, or $\rho$.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ Write pseudo-code that simulates the queue. Input should be $\lambda$,
    $\mu$, and the number $n$ of people that arrive at time $0$. The output must
    be a list of points in the form $(\tau, y)$ where $0 \le \tau \le T$ and $y
    = (+1)$ if at time $\tau$ there was an arrival, however $y=(-1)$ if at time
    $\tau$ there was a departure.
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We can use the fact about the Poisson Point Process that the spacing of
    events is exponentially distributed.

    \begin{table}[H]

        \begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.75\textwidth}|}
            \hline
            1 & We are given an arrival rate $\lambda$, a departure rate $\mu$,
            an initial number of people $n$, and a duration $T$.\\
            2 & Define $c=0$.\\
            3 & Define an empty array $\mathcal{E}$.\\
            4 & Simulate an exponentially distributed random variable with rate
            $\lambda$ and call it $a$.\\
            5 & Simulate an exponentially distributed random variable with rate
            $\mu$ and call it $d$.\\
            6 & If $a < d$, go to 7.\\
            7 & Set $c = c + a$, add $(c, +1)$ to $\mathcal{E}$, and set $n = n
            + 1$. Go to 10.\\
            8 & Else if $a > d$, if $n \neq 0$ then go to 9, else go to 7.\\
            9 & Set $c = c + d$, add $(c, -1)$ to $\mathcal{E}$, and set $n = n
            - 1$. Go to 10.\\
            10 & If $c < T$, go to 4, otherwise stop and remove the last element
            from $\mathcal{E}$.\\

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ Based on the pseudo-code, how can you determine $X_T$?
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Given the initial number of people in the Queue we can simply add each $-1$
    or $+1$ to that number resulting in our final amount at the end.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ Based on the pseudo-code how can you determine the fraction of time the
    server was busy between time $0$ and $T$?
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    If we assume that a non-busy server is one with zero ``jobs'' in the queue,
    then we can look at the duration of time where there were zero jobs and
    compare that to our total time $T$.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ Based on the pseudo-code how can you determine the inter-departure times
    from the queue (if any) between time $0$ and $T$?
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Any time we have a $-1$ as a result of the algorithm we can assume that it
    was a departure (by definition). Therefore these times are just the times
    that $-1$ values appear.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    \textbf{Implement your code. Let $(\lambda, \mu, T) = (1, 2, 50)$ and $n$
    according to the stationary distribution.}
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We can find our stationary distribution now that we have actual values.

            $n$ & $\pi(n)$\\
            \hline
            $0$ & $0.5$\\
            $1$ & $0.25$\\
            $2$ & $0.125$\\
            $3$ & $0.0625$\\
            $4$ & $0.03125$\\
            $5$ & $0.015625$\\
            $6$ & $0.0078125$\\
            $7$ & $0.00390625$\\
            $8$ & $0.001953125$\\
            $9$ & $0.0009765625$\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Stationary Distribution, $\pi(n)$}

    This is just a Geometric Distribution (starting at 0). See
    Appendix~\ref{app:code} for code.

    @ Verify your answer in part (2) via simulations.
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We can plot the histogram.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./xt_dist.png}
    \end{figure}

    This looks exactly as we imagined it would.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ Verify your answer in part (3).
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We can create another histogram.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./time_free.png}
    \end{figure}

    I was completely wrong about the distribution here, I had imagined it would
    be simply a ratio of our $\lambda$ to our $\mu$, but these results are
    completely different. Looking up the results online, it turns out that this
    is a modified Bessel function of the first
    kind.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/1_queue\#Busy_period_of_server}}

    \vspace{0.5cm}
    @ According to Theorem 4.10, if $X$ is in equilibrium then the output
    process of the queue is a homogeneous Poisson (point) process with intensity
    $\lambda$. Verify by simulating the inter-departure times from the queue.
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We can draw a similar graph as in the last lab to show the Poisson Point
    Process.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./poissonprocess.png}
    \end{figure}

    This looks exactly like a Poisson Process!
