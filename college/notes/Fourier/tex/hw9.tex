\section{Poisson's Formula}

Consider Laplace's Equation on a disk of radius $a$:

\mn{%
    \frac{1}{r} \partial_r\pren{r \partial_r u} + \frac{1}{r^2} \partial_\theta^2 u = 0
        & \qquad 0 < r < a & \qquad 0 < \theta < 2 \pi\\
    u(a, \theta) = f(\theta), & \qquad 0 < \theta < 2\pi \nonumber
}\label{eq:disklaplace}

along with geometric boundary conditions,

\mn{%
    u(r, 0) = u(r, 2p) & \qquad \partial_\theta u(r, 0) = \partial_\theta u(r, 2\pi) & \qquad 0 < r < a\\
    u(0, q) \text{ bounded} & \qquad 0 < \theta < 2 \pi \nonumber
}\label{eq:boundary}

Recall from class that the series solution of this problem is

\mn{%
    u(r, \theta) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \pren{\frac{r}{a}}^n \pren{a_n \cos(n\theta) + b_a \sin(n\theta)}
}\label{eq:seriessolution}

where

\ms{%
    a_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta) \, d\theta, \quad
    a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta) \cos(n\theta) \, d\theta, \quad
    b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta) \sin(n\theta) \, d\theta
}

Poisson's formula, given below, provides a different representation of the solution, as an integral over $f(\theta)$
around the boundary of the disk. The purpose of this problem is to derive Poisson's formula.

\begin{easylist}[enumerate]
    @ Insert the expression for each Fourier coefficient into the series solution and swap the order of the infinite sum
    and integration. You should have an expression of the form

    \mn{%
        u(r, \theta) = \int_0^{2\pi} f\pren{\theta^\prime}\cren{\ldots} \, d\theta^\prime
    }

    with an infinite series involving $r$ and trigonometric functions of $\theta$ in the braces $\cren{\ldots}$.

    @ Use a trig identity to simplify each term within the sum. You should end up with terms proportional to
    $\cos\bren{n\pren{\theta-\theta^\prime}}$.

    @ Sum the infinite series. Recall the calculation of the Dirichlet kernel way back when we studied Fourier series.
    If you rewrite

    \ms{%
        \cos\bren{n\pren{\theta-\theta^\prime}} =
        \frac{
            \exp\pren{in\pren{\theta-\theta^\prime}} +
            \exp\pren{-in\pren{\theta-\theta^\prime}}
        }{2}
    }

    the series becomes two geometric series, which you can sum. Deduce Poisson's formula

    \mn{%
        u(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{a^2 - r^2}{a^2 - 2ar \cos\pren{\theta - \theta^\prime} + r^2}
        f\pren{\theta^\prime} \, d\theta^\prime
    }\label{eq:poissonform}

    The integral has the form of a convolution product of the Poisson kernel,

    \mn{%
        P(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{a^2-r^2}{a^2 - 2ar \cos\pren{\theta - \theta^\prime} + r^2}
    }

    and the boundary data $f(\phi) = u(a, \phi)$:

    \mn{%
        u(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} P(r, \theta-\theta^\prime)f(\theta^\prime) \, d\theta^\prime
    }
\end{easylist}
