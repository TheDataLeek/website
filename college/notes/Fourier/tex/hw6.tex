\section{}

Let $v(x, t)$ denote the solution of the following problem.

\begin{align*}
    v_t &= k v_{xx} + \alpha v + Q(x, t) \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t > 0\\
    v(0, t) &= f_0(t), v(L, t) = f_L(t) \qquad && t > 0\\
    v(x, 0) &= V(x) \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t = 0\\
\end{align*}

Where $k > 0$, $L > 0$ and $\alpha$ are fixed constants $f_0(t)$ and $f_L(t)$ are known functions of $t$, $V(x)$ is a
known function of $x$, and $Q(x, t)$ is a known function of both variables. We seek to prove that this problem has at
most one solution, for any choice of the functions $\{ f_0(t), f_L(t), V(x), Q(x, t) \}$.\\

\NewList
\begin{easylist}[enumerate]
    @ By mimicking the proof given in the Outline of Method, in the Homework Set, show that this problem has at most one
    solution for a range of real values of $\alpha$. State clearly the range of values of $\alpha$ for which the problem
    has at most one solution. If there is a restriction on the space of functions for which the uniqueness proof
    applies, state that restriction clearly. Support your conclusions with the appropriate work.

    @@ \textit{Assume that Two Solutions Exist}

    As with the outline, we assume that the problem has two solutions, $v_1(x, t)$ and $v_2(x, t)$. We will now prove
    that they are the same using contradiction.

    @@ \textit{Define the Difference}

    We define the difference between the two solutions to be

    \[
        \delta(x, t) = v_1(x, t) - v_2(x, t)
    \]

    This equation has its own set of equations determined by subtracting the problem above from itself.

    \begin{align}\label{1:delta}
        \delta_t &= k \delta_{xx} + \alpha \delta \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t > 0 \nonumber \\
        \delta(0, t) &= 0, \delta(L, t) = 0 \qquad && t > 0\\
        \delta(x, 0) &= 0 \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t = 0 \nonumber
    \end{align}

    It is obvious by inspection that $\delta(x, t) \equiv 0$ satisfies~\eqref{1:delta}. We now must show that this is
    the only solution to~\eqref{1:delta}.

    @@ \textit{Multiply the PDE and Integrate}

    We will multiply equation~\eqref{1:delta} by $\delta(x, t)$ (following the pattern in the notes). This yields the
    following equation.

    \begin{align*}
        \delta \delta_t &= k \delta \delta_{xx} + \alpha \delta^2\\
        \pren{\frac{\delta^2}{2}}_t &= k \delta \delta_{xx} + \alpha \delta^2
    \end{align*}

    We can integrate over the interval $[0, L]$.

    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{L}(t) &= \int_0^L \pren{\frac{\delta^2}{2}} \, dx & \text{Note, this is strictly} \ge 0\\
        &= \int_0^L k \delta \delta_{xx} \, dx + \int_0^L \alpha \delta^2 \, dx\\
        &= \bren{k \delta \delta_x}\bigg|_0^L - \int_0^L k \delta_x^2 \, dx + \int_0^L \alpha \delta^2 \, dx\\
    \end{align*}

    @@ \textit{Examine the Integration}

    We can determine by inspection using the boundary conditions that $\mathcal{L}(0) = 0$. We also can take the time
    derivative.

    \begin{align*}
        \frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dt} &= - \bren{\int_0^L k \delta_x^2 \, dx}_t + \bren{\int_0^L \alpha \delta^2 \, dx}_t
    \end{align*}

    For any $\alpha \le 0$, $\mathcal{L}_t(t)$ is less than zero. Therefore we can determine that for any $\alpha \le
    0$, $\mathcal{L} \equiv 0$ for all $t \ge 0$.

    @@ \textit{Examine Possible Removable Discontinuities}

    Almost done, but we need to examine the possibility of removable discontinuities. Shadowing the notes, assume
    $\delta(x, t)$ is continuous in $x \in (0, L)$, $t \ge 0$. Assume at some time $t^* \ge 0$, there exists $x^*, x \in
    (0, L)$, where $\delta^2(x^*, t^*) = p^2 > 0$, where $p$ is a fixed real number. Then because $\delta^2(x, t)$ is
    continuous in $x$, there must be an open interval $(x^* - \epsilon < x < x^* + \epsilon)$ in which $\delta^2(x, t^*)
    > p^2 / 2 > 0$. But this implies

    \ms{%
        \mathcal{L}(t^*) = \int_0^L \bren{\frac{\delta^2(x, t^*)}{2}} \, dx \ge
            \int_{x^* - \epsilon}^{x^* + \epsilon} \bren{\frac{\delta^2(x, t^*)}{2}} \, dx \ge
            \frac{p^2}{4} \cdot 2 \epsilon > 0.
    }

    Therefore $\mathcal{L}(t^*)$ does not satisfy our initial assumption. Therefore no such $(x^*, t^*)$ exists.

    @@ \textit{Conclusion}

    Since $\delta$ is zero for all $t$, there exists at most one solution that is continuous in $x \in (0, L)$, for $t >
    0$.

    @ For $\alpha$ in the range for which the problem has a unique solution, set $Q(x, t) = 0$, $f_0(t)=0$, $f_L(t)=0$,
    $V(x,0)=1$, and find $v(x, t)$ in the form of a Fourier Series.\\

    Assume $\alpha \le 0$, and

    \begin{align*}
        v_t &= k v_{xx} + \alpha v \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t > 0\\
        v(0, t) &= 0, v(L, t) = 0 \qquad && t > 0\\
        v(x, 0) &= 1 \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t = 0\\
    \end{align*}

    We can find the Fourier series solution.

    Let $v_t = 0$,

    \ms{%
        0 &= k v_{xx} + \alpha v\\

    Therefore the steady state solution is 0.

The beam equation is neat.

\begin{align*}
    \rho w_{tt} &= -EI w_{xxxx} + Q(x, t) \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t > 0\\
    w(0, t) &= w_x(0, t) = w_{xx}(L, t) = w_{xxx}(L, t) = 0 \qquad && t > 0\\
    w(x, 0) &= W(x), w_t(x, 0) = S(x) \qquad & 0 < x < L \qquad & t = 0\\
\end{align*}

Where $\rho$ is the linear mass density, $E$ is Young's modulus, and $I$ is the second moment of area are fixed positive
constants.
