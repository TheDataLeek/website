Flitwick believes he can develop a faster algorithm, which takes only $g(n)$ time, but developing it will take $t$ days. Acme only needs to solve a problem of size $n$ once. Should Acme pay Flitwick to develop the faster algorithm or should they stick with their current algorithm? Explain.}

    @ \textit{Is an array that is in sorted order also a min-heap? Justify.}
    @@ Technically no, they are not the same. They have differing data structures, however they are more similar than not upon further inspection. A sorted array has the form {\ttfamily [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} while a min-heap has the form

            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/Min-heap.png}
            \caption{A Sample Min-Heap}

                value = node_value
        \end{pythoncode*}

    As is evident the fundamental data structures expressing the two are not similar in the slightest. This being said however, a sorted array will correspond the following min-heap

        \begin{figure}[ht]

            \caption{The Min-Heap for our Array}
        \end{figure}

    When the min-heap is accessed top-down, left-to-right it will have a one-to-one correspondence to our array. So to put it succinctly, the two data structures are not the same, however they have similar appearance and behavior.
