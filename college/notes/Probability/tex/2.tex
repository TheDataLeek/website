    @@ An elevator starts at the basement with 8 people (not including the elevator operator) and discharges them all by the time it reaches the top floor, number 6. In how many ways could the operator have perceived the people leaving the elevator if all people look alike to him? What if the 8 people consisted of 5 men and 3 women and the operator could tell a man from a woman?
    @@@ In the first part of this problem we can view the 8 individuals as indistinguishable balls, and the floors as distinguishable urns. Therefore, we can rephrase the problem to look as such:

    \[ \underbrace{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6}_{Urns} = \underbrace{8}_{Balls} \]

    If we also allow for no individuals to leave on certain floors, there are a known amount of solutions.

    \[ \begin{pmatrix}n + r - 1\\ r - 1\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow \boxed{\begin{pmatrix}13\\5\end{pmatrix} } \]

    @@@ For the second part of the problem, if the idiot operator can now discern the difference between a man and a woman, the problem is phrased in two parts.

    \[ \begin{cases}
            x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 5 \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}10\\5\end{pmatrix}\\\\
            x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 3 \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}8\\5\end{pmatrix}\\
    \end{cases} \]

    However this only accounts for the two separate groups. In order to obtain the total number of solutions, they must be multiplied together. So the final answer is

    \[ \boxed{\begin{pmatrix}10\\5\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}8\\5\end{pmatrix} } \]

    @@ In an experiment, die is rolled continually until a 6 appears, at which point the experiment stops. What is the sample space of this experiment? Let $E_n$ denote the event that $n$ rolls are necessary to complete the experiment. What points of the sample space are contained in $E_n$? What is ${\left( \bigcup^\infty_1 E_n \right)}^c$?
    @@@ Assuming the die in question is a six-sided die, The sample space for this experiment is

       \[ \left\{ (6), (1,6), (2, 6), (3, 6), \cdots, (1, 1, 6), (1, 2, 6), \cdots \right\} \]

       If the die is not a D6, this pattern holds true for numbers greater than six, since rolling six is our only end condition.

    @@@ In any event, $E_n$, the die may roll any number in the sample space, therefore $E_n$ covers all points in the sample space.
    @@@ Going off our previous statement, since any event is possible, the complement of the union equals the null set.

    @@@ Interpret the sample space.
    @@@@ Since there are only two outcomes for each toss, the game will continue until a player flips heads. Therefore the space is infinite in cardinality, and all events end with a heads.
    @@@ Define the following events in terms of $S$:
    @@@@ $A$ wins $ = A \to $ This creates a new set, one where $A$ is the winner.
       \[ E_A = \left\{ x | x \in S \wedge 1_i \equiv 1 \mod 3 \right\} \text{ and } E_A \subset S \]

    @@@@ ${(A \cup B)}^c \to$ This is the same as asking for every event where $C$ is the winner.
       \[ E_C = \left\{ x | x \in S \wedge 1_i \equiv 3 \mod 3 \right\} \text{ and } E_C \subset S \]
       Where $1_i$ is the index of the heads.

    @@ Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events for which $P(A) = .3$ and $P(B) = .5$. What is the probability that
    @@@ either $A$ or $B$ occurs?
    @@@@ Since they are mutually exclusive, this can be expressed as $P(A) + P(B) = \boxed{0.8}$.
    @@@ $A$ occurs but $B$ does not?
    @@@@ Again, they are mutually exclusive, so if $A$ occurs, $B$ by definition will not. Therefore we just need the probability of $A \to P(A) = 0.3$
    @@@ both $A$ and $B$ occur?
    @@@@ By definition of mutually exclusive, the events cannot both occur. Therefore the probability of this event is zero.

    @@ A retail establishment accepts either the American Express or the VISA credit card. A total of 24 percent of its customers carry an American Express card, 61 percent carry a VISA card, and 11 percent carry both cards. What percentage of its customers carry a credit card that the establishment will accept?
    @@@ This can be solved with the exclusion/inclusion principle. Let $A$ be the set of American Express cardholders, $B$ be the set of VISA cardholders, and $C$ be those that carry both.
        \[ |A| + |B| - |C| \to 24 + 61 - 11 = 74 \]
       Therefore $74$\% of the customers carry a valid card.

    @@ What is the sample space, $S$ (describe in words or in symbols), and its cardinality, $|S|$?
    @@@ The sample space, $S$, is all combinations of people selected. If we let $R$ represent the room of people to choose from

        \[ S = \left\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) | x_n \in R, x_n \text{ is unique}, \text{ no combination is repeated} \right\} \]

    It's cardinality therefore can be expressed as

        \[ |S| = \begin{pmatrix}15\\5\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow \frac{15!}{5!10!} \Rightarrow 3003 \]

    @@ Let $A$ be the event that 3 men and 2 women are selected. What is the probability of $A$?
    @@@ In order to solve this we need to determine how many combinations there are with 3 men and 2 women. This can be broken up into two separate parts.

        \[ \begin{pmatrix}8\\3\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}7\\2\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow 1176 \]

        According to our previous result, the cardinality of the set is 3003, meaning each combination has a 1 in 3003 chance of occurring. Therefore, this probability is merely

        \[ \frac{1}{\begin{pmatrix}15\\5\end{pmatrix} } \cdot \begin{pmatrix}8\\3\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}7\\2\end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\frac{56}{143} \approx 0.3916} \]

    @@ Let $B$ be the event that at least 2 women serve on the committee. What is the probability of $B$?
    @@@ Again the key to this problem is to identify how many combinations satisfy the condition, and then determine the probability based off the cardinality. Since all conditions are mutually exclusive, we can look at them independently.

    @@ What is the event $A \cap B$ (describe in words or in symbols)? What is its probability?
    @@@ This event is when there are at least two women, intersected with two women and three men. This results in a committee where there are two women and three men. The probability of this event is the same as it is above, namely

        \[ \frac{1}{\begin{pmatrix}15\\5\end{pmatrix} } \cdot \begin{pmatrix}8\\3\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}7\\2\end{pmatrix} = \boxed{\frac{56}{143} \approx 0.3916} \]

    @@ Suppose one man and one woman are married and, by the rules of the committee, can not serve together. How does the sample space change in this situation? Re-calculate $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.
    @@@ In this situation the sample space shifts to only include committees without the couple together, however they can serve independently. Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be our couple. Therefore, the sample space now becomes

    \[
        \begin{aligned}
             S = \{ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) | & x_n \in R,\\
