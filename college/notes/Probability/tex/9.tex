    @ \textit{Chapter 5, \#31 --} A fire station is to be located along a road of length $A$, $A < \infty$. If fires
    occur at points uniformly chosen on $(0, A)$, where should the station be located so as to minimize the expected
    distance from the fire? That is, choose $a$ so as to minimize $\left(E\left[\abs{X - a}\right]\right)$ when $X$ is
    uniformly distributed over $(0, A)$.\newline
    @@ By definition, a uniform distribution has equal probability at any given point. This means that wherever the fire
    station is located, there is an equal chance of any given point containing a fire. Therefore, the best location for
    the fire station to be location is the exact center of the range, or $\boxed{\infty / 2}$.

    @ Now suppose that the road is of infinite length -- stretching from point 0 outward to $\infty$.  If the distance of
    a fire from point 0 is exponentially distributed with rate $\lambda$, where should the fire station now be located?
    That is, we want to minimize $E[\abs{X âˆ’ a}]$, where $X$ is now exponential with rate $\lambda$.
    @@ The exponential distribution also has a predefined definition which can be used to determine the best location
    for the fire station. By definition, $\lambda$ is equal to the rate of decay, meaning the mean is equal to
    $\frac{1}{\lambda}$. Therefore the best location for the fire station is equal to $\boxed{1 / \lambda}$.

    the cumulative hazard function, $\Lambda$.

    The roots of the equation will be real if and only if the portion under the square root is positive, therefore we're

    @ \textit{Chapter 5, \#41 --} Find the distribution of $R = A \sin \theta$ , where $A$ is a fixed constant and
    $\theta$ is uniformly distributed on $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$. Such a random variable $R$ arises in the theory of
    ballistics. If a projectile is fired from the origin at an angle $\alpha$ from the earth with a speed $v$, then the
    point $R$ at which it returns to the earth can be expressed as $R = (v^2/g) \sin 2 \alpha$, where $g$ is the
    gravitational constant, equal to 980 centimeters per second squared.
    @@ Looking at this as a transformation of a random variable we can follow similar steps from last time.

    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \theta = \frac{1}{\pi} \qquad R = A \sin \theta\\
            P(R \le r) \Rightarrow P(A \sin \theta \le r)\\

    We know that the distribution is uniform, therefore the input does not matter, and we obtain

    \[
        R = \frac{1}{A \sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{A^2} } } \left( \frac{1}{\pi} \right)
    \]

    We also know that the integration of this random variable from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$ \textit{must} equal 1. Knowing
    this, we can solve for $A$.

    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \int^{\pi/2}_{-\pi/2} \frac{1}{A \sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{A^2} } } \left( \frac{1}{\pi} \right) \, dr &=& 1\\

            A &=& \frac{\pi}{2}
        \end{aligned}
