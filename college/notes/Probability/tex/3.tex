    @@ An elementary school is offering 3 language classes: one in Spanish, one in French, and one in German. The classes are open to any of the 100 students in the school. There are 28 students in the Spanish class, 26 in the French class, and 16 in the German class. There are 12 students that are in both Spanish and French, 4 that are in both Spanish and German, and 6 that are in both French and German. In addition, there are 2 students taking all 3 classes.
    @@@ If a student is chosen randomly, what is the probability that he or she is not in any of the language classes?
    @@@@ Let $S$ be the set of students in Spanish, $F$ the set of French students, and $G$ the set of German students. If we define $C$ as the set of students taking language classes, we can determine the cardinality of $C$.

        \[ \begin{aligned}
        |E| =& |S| + |F| + |G| - |S \cap F| - |S \cap G| - |F \cap G| + |S \cap F \cap G|\\
            =& 28 + 26 + 16 - 12 - 4 - 6 + 2\\
            =& 50
        \end{aligned} \]

        If we let $E_1$ be the event the a student is taking a language class, we can determine the probabability of $E_1$.

        \[ 50/100 = 0.5 \]

        Similarly, if we let $E_2$ be the event that a student is \textit{not} in a language class we can determine the probability by $E_1$'s converse.

        \[ E_2 = 1 - E_1 = 1 - 0.5 = \boxed{0.5} \]

    @@@ If a student is chosen randomly, what is the probability that he or she is taking exactly one language class?
    @@@@ Again, we can use the inclusion exclusion principle to determine the cardinality of this set. Let $L$ be the set of students taking exactly one language class, and the other sets defined above.

        \[ \begin{aligned}
            |L| =& |S| + |F| + |G| - 2|S \cap F| - 2|S \cap G| - 2|F \cap G| + 4|S \cap F \cap G|\\
                =& 28 + 26 + 16 - 24 - 8 - 12 + 8\\
                =& 34
        \end{aligned} \]

        To turn this into a probability, we simply divide by the cardinality of the set of all students.

        \[ 34/100 = \boxed{0.34} \]

    @@@ If 2 students are chosen randomly, what is the probability that at least 1 is taking a language class?
    @@@@ Recall that $C$ is the set of all students not taking at least one language class. We've determined its cardinality, and we can now apply that information to determine the current problem. Each student (as was proven in part (A)) has a $0.5$ chance of not being in a language class. Therefore the probability of at least one student not being in a language class is

        \[ \frac{\binom{50}{2} }{\binom{100}{2} } = \frac{49}{198} \]

    Therefore we can find the probability of at least one student being in a language class

        \[ 1 - \frac{49}{198} = \boxed{\frac{149}{198} } \]

    @@ The following data were given in a study of a group of 1000 subscribers to a certain magazine: In reference to job, marital status, and education, there were 312 professionals, 470 married persons, 525 college graduates, 42 professional college graduates, 147 married college graduates, 86 married professionals, and 25 married professional college graduates. Show that the numbers reported in the study must be incorrect.\newline

    @@@ Let $P$, $M$, and $C$ denote, respectively, the set of professionals, married persons, and college graduates. Also let $S$ be the entire population. We can determine the cardinality of $S$ with the inclusion/exclusion principle.

        \[ \begin{aligned}
            |S| =& |P| + |M| + |C| - |P \cap M| - |P \cap C| - |M \cap C| + |P \cap M \cap C|\\
                =& 312 + 470 + 525 - 86 - 42 - 147 + 25\\
                =& 1058
        \end{aligned} \]

        Since the set (as is defined) has more individuals than surveyed, it must be incorrect.

        \[ \binom{52}{5} = 2598960 \]
        And to determine the probability we simply divide.

        \[ \binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{2} \]
        Now we need to pick three other cards that are distinct, being careful not to overcount ordering.
        \[ \frac{\binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1} \binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1} \binom{10}{1} \binom{4}{1} }{3!} = 1098240 \]

    @@@@ Using a similar process, we first find our pairs, and then the other cards, being careful not to overcount.
        \[ \binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{2} \binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1} \frac{1}{2!} = 123552 \]
        Dividing to find the probability we get
        \[ \boxed{0.04754} \]
    @@@ three of a kind? (This occurs when the cards have denominations $a, a, a, b, c$, where $a, b$, and $c$ are all distinct.)
    @@@@ Extending the theory, we can find our three of a kind first, and then determine the other two cards, taking care not to overcount.
        \[ \binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{3} \binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1} \binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1} \frac{1}{2!} = 54912 \]

    @@@@ Extending the theory further, we apply the same principle.
        \[ \binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{4} \binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1} = 624 \]

    @@@ Again, due to the relatively small scope of the problem we can look at each draw separately. The chance of $A$ drawing red on the first turn is $\frac{3}{10}$. On the second turn, we need $B$ to \textit{not} draw a red ball, and so the probability of this is $1 - \frac{3}{9}$. Therefore on the third turn the probability is $\left( 1 - \frac{3}{10}\right) \left(1 - \frac{3}{9} \right) \frac{3}{8}$. Continuing this progression,

        Using set notation, this problem can be displayed as

        \[ \begin{aligned}
            |(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3) - (A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3)| =& |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_3| - |A_2 \cap A_3|\\
                                                                =& |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - (|A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 \cup A_2|) -\\
                                                                 & (|A_1| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cup A_3|) - (|A_2| + |A_3| - |A_2 \cup A_3|)\\
                                                                =& |A_1 \cup A_2| + |A_1 \cup A_3| + |A_2 \cup A_3| - |A_1| - |A_2| - |A_3|\\
        \end{aligned} \]

        Lastly we can find the probability of this event occurring.

        \[ \begin{aligned}
                P(E) =& P(A_1 \cup A_2) + P(A_1 \cup A_3) + P(A_2 \cup A_3) - P(A_1) - P(A_2) - P(A_3)\\
                     =& 0.18 + 0.19 + 0.18 - 0.17 - 0.07 - 0.13\\
                     =& \boxed{0.16}
            \end{aligned}
        \]

\end{easylist}
