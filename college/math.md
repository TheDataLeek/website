Many or most of the articles here are from class notes, projects, or homeworks that I touched up -

# Projects Inspired by Classwork

* [building fractals by hand](fractals)
* [the algorithms behind interpolation & splines](interpolation)
* [numerical analysis of vector fields](nonlinear-dynamics-homework4)
* [chaotic dynamics and strange attractors](chaotic-dynamics)
* [numerical analysis of one dimensional maps](one-dimensional-maps)
* [ordinary differential equation solving with 4th-order Runge-Kutta](ode-solving)
* [the algorithms behind numerical ootfinding](rootfinding)

# Class Notes

During college I found it especially effective to write my notes by hand and then transcribe to LaTeX as a study method. Later, I sped up enough in my transcriptions to do it live during class and then only writing down the more complex equations to fully convert later.
